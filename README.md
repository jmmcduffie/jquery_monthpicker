jQuery Monthpicker
==================

Author: [Jeremy McDuffie](mailto:jeremy.mcduffie@gmail.com)

A (very simple) "monthpicker" plugin for jQuery.

My primary goal was to simplify the population of the new HTML5 `input[type="month"]`, which I find myself using very frequently.

This is very much a work-in-progress.
